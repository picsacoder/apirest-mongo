# API REST MongoDB



## About 🧑‍💻

A simple API maked with MongoDB,Express,NodeJS. <br>
I plan to use this API for a react project in the future. <br>
Feel safe to use it in your own project.

## Installation guide 🔨


You need to create a DB in MongoDB: 
```
$ mongo
```

```
use api_rest
```

Then clone this repository:


```
$ git clone https://github.com/picsacoder/apirest-mongo.git
```

```
$ cd apirest-mongo
```

```
$ npm start
```

*Note: If the port 5000 is in use you need to change the line **3** in **index.js**
```
const port = (Another port);
```

With that the api will be connected to the database and listening on the port that we have assigned.

## Using the API 🤖

I recommend that you use postman.

The routes are these:

<ul>
  <li>POST /register</li>
  <li>POST /login</li>
  <li>POST /delete</li>

</ul>
